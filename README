Graphui
--------
An attempt to implement Graphui using some sort of FRP framework.


Problems / TODO:
================

* Pass graph attributes (not just node and edge attributes) to and from dot.

  * Then use the graph size to scale correctly the coordinates/sizes returned from dot onto the display size
  * Will require unsafePerformIO to cover up for the IO of the GraphViz.graphToGraph?

* Use clustered graphs to allow grouping (clustering) of nodes or parts of the graph
