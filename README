Graphui
--------
An attempt to implement Graphui using some sort of FRP framework.


Problems / TODO:
================

* wxFruit isn't good because it only places handlers on specific event types in the widgets it supports.
* go back to SDL? better at event handling, but I will need to figure out how to implement the "reactimate" or whatever function to feed these events into Yampa.
