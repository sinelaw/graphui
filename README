Graphui
--------
An attempt to implement Graphui using some sort of FRP framework.

Key Bindings
============
a           = Add New Nodes
Mouse Click = Select Element.
      (Connect two nodes by clicking on source and then on destination.)


Problems / TODO:
================
* Use more samples on longer bezier lines

* Fork dot generation to a different thread

* Add width and antialiasing control to drawingcombinators

* Update to use GL.GLdouble instead of Double whenever we pass stuff to Draw library. Then, use the version of the library that doesn't do any "convReal" - it uses GL.GLdouble instead of Double everywhere. This really improves performance.

* How to 'sample' the display at sane intervals regardless of the event activity going on? (Yampa question)
  * Use Yampa.Utilities.sample? For now I'm using an IORef to measure time since last render
  
* Use clustered graphs to allow grouping (clustering) of nodes or parts of the graph
